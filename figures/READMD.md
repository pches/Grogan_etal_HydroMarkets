Place scripts for recreating your paper's figures in this directory. Update this `README.md` with instructions for figure reproduction.

File calculate_thresholds_Figure2.R does 2 steps. (1) It calculates the wet vs paper right threshold for each WMA, based on hydro model output. The result of this step is provided in this folder, in 2 data files called wma_threshold_dates_Scenario2.csv and wma_threshold_dates_Scenario2a.csv. (2) The script uses the 2 provided data files to make the maps shown in Figure 2.  To fully reproduce these maps, you will need to download the WMA shapefile from https://data.msdlive.org/records/v5ree-qj344 and the US State shapefile from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2015/geo/carto-boundary-file.html.  Note: this script uses the raster and rasterViz packages, which are no longer being maintained.  These were the packages originally used to produce the figures, but after publication we can update the code to use the terra package. If a reviewer requires a switch to terra, please contact Danielle Grogan for updated code: danielle.grogan@unh.edu.
